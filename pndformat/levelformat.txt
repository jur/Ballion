The files in directory levels have the following format:

#define MAX_LEVEL_SIZE (40 * 32)

typedef struct level_header
{
    int width;
    int height;
    int startX;
    int startY;
    int startColor;
    int startDirection;
    int reserved1;
    int reserved2;
    unsigned char data[MAX_LEVEL_SIZE];
} __attribute__((packed)) level_header_t;

The level data are accessed as follows:
level.data[x * height + y]
Each byte in data represents a block. The byte tells the
number of the block in the file resources/block.png.
startX and startY are the start position of the ball.
startColor is the color of the ball.
startDirection is the direction of the ball at level
entry (+1 or -1).
